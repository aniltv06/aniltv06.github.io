## 🚀 Why This Resume Site?

I wanted to create something more interactive than a PDF. The website showcases not just what I've done, but also demonstrates my technical skills:
- Modern web development with vanilla JavaScript
- Responsive design without frameworks
- Performance optimization (lazy-loading libraries, efficient rendering)
- 3D graphics using Three.js
- Data visualization with Chart.js
