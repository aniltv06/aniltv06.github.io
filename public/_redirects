# Netlify Redirects File
# This provides fallback routing for single-page applications
# Place this in the public directory so it gets copied to dist

# Serve index.html for all routes that don't match a static file
# This ensures deep links work and 404s are handled gracefully
/*    /index.html   200

# Optional: Redirect www to non-www (or vice versa)
# https://www.aniltv06.github.io/*  https://aniltv06.github.io/:splat  301!

# Optional: Force HTTPS (Netlify does this by default, but you can be explicit)
# http://aniltv06.github.io/*  https://aniltv06.github.io/:splat  301!
